## IP address

- If a computer is an apartment building, the IP address of the building is the the relative address to the building.   
- Relative address meaning that the address is only valid within certain context. Once you are out of context, the address will not make much sense.
- For instance, you can say you live at block 35 on xxx street in the context of your city, but a friend of yours going to mail to you from other side of the world, your friend cannot just write your address as "block 35, xxx street" only, because the address is only specific enough within the context of your city.

## Domain Name

- Domain Name is the brand name of your building. If your building is an ordinary residential building, you tells your friends specifically that your are at "block 35 on xxx street".
- But if you are the president of the United States, you just need to tell people, I live in the White House, where "the White House" is just your Domain Name, and people instantly know which building your are referring to and if they look up on google, they will know the while House is at "1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW".

## Mac Address

- Media Access Control
- MAC address is kind of like the ID of the electricity meter of your building. It is attached to your building forever from the day your building was built.

## Port Number

- Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
    - `20`: FTP
    - `21`: FTP
    - `22`: SSH
    - `25`: SMTP
    - `80`: HTTP
- Port Number is like different ways to enter your building. Normal human being like HTTP always use the main lobby(80). Secret Agent like SSH enters the building from underground carpark(22). The air like FTP just enters the building through the windows(20) and doors(21).


# TCP/IP Model



## Physical Layer: Binary Transmission

- Bits

## Data Link Layer: MAC and LLC (Physical Addressing)

- Frames

## Network Layer / Internet Layer: IP (Logical Addressing)

- Packets

## Transport Layer: TCP, UDP (End-to-end Connection)

- Segments

## Application Layer

- Data

#### Session: Sockets, NetBIOS
#### Presentation: SSL, ASCII
#### Application: FTP, SMTP, POP3, DNS, HTTP
